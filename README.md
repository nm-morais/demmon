# DeMMon


Demmon is my thesis project, composed of a decentralized management and monitoring overlay network built on top of the go-babel framework (https://github.com/nm-morais/go-babel).

Its purpose is to establish a latency-optimized hierarchical overlay, and then use these connections to collect and propagate metrics regarding the execution of its composing nodes, and the applications hosted on them.
